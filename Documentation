I started off this project by using my instructors code. I then went to the filters and tweaked them to experiment what would happen. I started off by using p5 reference to better understand how colors and pixel density works in code. I then used the starting code and changed the invert colors filter. I tried making a infrared filter by nullifying the green and blue modifiers and it turns out the infrared filter worked. I then went online to learn how pixel density works and I can now blur our images. This project overall has been the most fruitful to me because it is the first assignment where I did not need much external help and can mostly go off of my own intellect and tweaking existing code.
